			<p class="about-text"> I grew up in Montclair New Jersey. All my schooling was in Montclair as well. Then after the 8th grade I moved to Little Falls. For high school I went to DePaul Catholic in Wayne. After I graduated I began college. I studied liberal arts/humanities at Bergan Community then transfered to Passaic Community. After I acheved my Associates Degree I went to William Paterson University.</p><br>
			<p class="about-text"> On my spare time I enjoy seeing my family and friends but what I really love to do is travel. There is something about seeing the way other coultures live that interests me. Especially when visiting Europe; something about seeing how old and beautiful their buildings are, their art, and food..</p><br>
